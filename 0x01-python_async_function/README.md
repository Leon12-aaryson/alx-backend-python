## ASYNC in python backend
This is used to write programs that are asynchronous. Asynchronous programs are those that can run multiple sessions or blocks of code at different times till the particular request gets a response.

### Synchronous
Is where the program has to wait for each rewuest to be processed one at a time as the others wait for one to complete then another request is made. 

This kind of programming is more of a time concious way of writing programs whereby the synchronous programs cause delay in programs while asynchrnous write programs that inturn produce projects that help in time concious programs and hence save time and reduced runtimes
